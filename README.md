# Issue-Tracker
Welcome to my code repository!Here, you will find the source code for an innovative issue tracking application .This application is designed to simplify the process of tracking issues and provides an intuitive user interface that enhances productivity .<br>

It allows users to enter a detailed description of each issue and assign a severity level. With the help of chance.js, the application generates a unique ID for each issue, making it easy to identify and track. The issues are then stored in local storage, ensuring that users can access them even after closing the browser.<br>

The application also includes a delete button that allows users to remove issues from the application and a close button that temporarily closes issues without deleting them. This feature is particularly useful for tracking issues that are in progress or require further investigation.<br>

Thank you for taking the time to explore my code repository!I am open to any feedback or suggestions for improvement, as I am always looking to refine my skills and develop better solutions.
